ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Employee Salary Prediction is a machine learning-powered web application built using Django that predicts 
whether an employee earns more than $50K or less than or equal to $50K based on various personal and professional attributes.
The project uses the well-known Adult Income Dataset (Census Income Dataset) and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, 
and a trained Random Forest Classifier to make predictions. 
It also includes visualizations and model explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparent insights 
into how the model makes decisions
